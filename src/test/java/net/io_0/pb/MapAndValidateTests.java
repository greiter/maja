/**
 * Narrative:
 *   As a map and validation API consumer
 *
 *   I want mapping and validation to be able to distinguish between absent and null values
 *   so that I can tread null as e.g. delete
 *
 *   and I want a single report containing all that went wrong during mapping and validation
 *   so that providing valid data gets easier
 *
 *   and I want to be able to deal with names
 *   so that I don't get problems with Java naming conventions
